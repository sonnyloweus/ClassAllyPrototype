b) A Member Firm Authorized User may terminate this Agreement at any time by terminating use of the Benefits and giving notice of termination to CLASSALLY. Such termination does not affect other Member Firm Authorized Users’ or the Member Firm’s obligations under the User Agreement, and the respective end user license agreements entered into with CLASSALLY.
c) CLASSALLY may terminate the User Agreement and this Agreement upon ten (10) days’ notice to Member Firm or Authorized User, as applicable, (i) upon the occurrence of a default by Member Firm, Authorized User, or any Member Firm Authorized User, under the User Agreement, or this Agreement, or (ii) upon the death or disability of a Member Firm Authorized User, (iii) if any Member Firm Authorized User cannot be located by CLASSALLY using the contact information provided to CLASSALLY by Member Firm. In addition, at any time on sixty (60) days’ notice, CLASSALLY may terminate one or more Membership Subscriptions if CLASSALLY generally discontinues the Membership Subscriptions for its members and authorized users.
d) CLASSALLY may, at its option and without any obligation to provide prior notice to Member Firm or Authorized User, immediately suspend access to and use of all Benefits, or any portion of the Benefits, upon the occurrence of any default by Member Firm of Authorized User, or the occurrence of any event which CLASSALLY believes may constitute a default, under this Agreement or the User Agreement. Such default may include the failure to pay any Monthly Fees, or one or more installments of any Initial Fee, when due. The suspension may include, in CLASSALLY’s sole discretion, a temporary suspension of Member Firm’s obligation to make payments to CLASSALLY. However, any such suspension shall not modify or reduce the amount owing by Member Firm or Authorized User, only the timing of the payment of such amounts owing. If the suspension was initiated by CLASSALLY and made without notice to Member Firm or Authorized User, CLASSALLY shall provide Member Firm or Authorized User, as applicable, notice of suspension of the Benefits within ten (10) days following the first day of suspension. Nothing under this Section 34(d) shall be construed as requiring CLASSALLY to suspend the Benefits prior to exercising its right of termination under this Agreement. Further, and notwithstanding any suspension, CLASSALLY may terminate this Agreement and the User Agreement at any time if the default on which the suspension was based has not been cured by Member Firm or Authorized User within a time acceptable to CLASSALLY.
e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this Agreement shall terminate no later than the date on which the User Agreement is terminated. Further, all of Member Firm Authorized User’s rights under this Agreement, including all rights to Benefits, shall terminate for such Member Firm Authorized User immediately and without notice if such Member Firm Authorized User ceases to be or fails to qualify as a Member Firm Authorized User as provided in this Agreement or the User Agreement, or any representation made in this Agreement by Member Firm Authorized User is at any time false or misleading.

g) Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, the license granted to Authorized User under this Agreement, including without limitation the license for the Benefits, shall terminate automatically.

g) Assignment/Delegation. Authorized User and Member Firm may not assign their rights or delegate any of their duties under this Agreement, including the engagement of and delegation of any obligations and duties to any agents or third parties. Any attempt to assign, transfer, or delegate any of Authorized User's or Member Firm’s rights, duties, or obligations under this Agreement or enter into any sublicenses without such consent is void. However, if Authorized User is a Member that terminates employment with Member Firm to become employed by another law firm, and neither Member nor Member Firm is in default under the User Agreement or this Agreement, then at the request of Member, and with the written consent of Member Firm, CLASSALLY agrees to terminate the User Agreement, and enter into a new User Agreement with the new law firm of Member. In such event, the material terms of the User Agreement being terminated will continue to apply to the new User Agreement. CLASSALLY may, in its sole discretion, charge an administrative fee in connection with the execution of the new User Agreement.
h) Waiver. The waiver by any party of, or the failure of any party to take action with respect to, any breach of any term, covenant or condition contained in this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such term, covenant or condition, or subsequent breach of the same, or any other term, covenant or condition contained in this Agreement.

In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of the User Agreement, and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall govern and prevail.

The following information (the "Educational Institution Information") is collected by ClassAlly:

8. How Long We Keep Data:  As guided by the educational institution, we retain Personal Student Information:
a) Request for Deletion or Transfer of Personal Student Information from educational institution: CLASSALLY acts on the documented orders of an Educational Institution to delete Personal Student Information before and after expiry of all CLASSALLY Educational Institution licenses, unless we are forced to maintain such information in order to comply with our legal obligations with law enforcement, settle conflicts, or enforce our agreements. CLASSALLY will make appropriate efforts to remove and/or de-identify such information within a commercially reasonable period of time under applicable laws upon instruction to delete Personal Student Information. CLASSALLY and the educational institution may consent to pass the Personal Student Details of the educational institution back to the educational institution upon termination of all educational institution licenses with ClassAlly. Under that situation, CLASSALLY would operate on the documented instruction of an educational institution to move the Personal Student Information of the educational institution to the Educational Institution and make appropriate attempts to transfer such information within a commercially reasonable period of time under applicable laws, unless we are required to maintain such information in order to comply with our legal obligations or with law enforcement authorities. According to the terms of the DPA or any arrangement between the educational institution and ClassAlly, Confidential Student Details for Educational Institutions in the EEA will be removed and transferred/ported.
b) Deactivated Accounts: We may consider that the Educational Institution's account is terminated 365 days after all CLASSALLY licenses expire without the educational institution's use, reactivation, or renewal. We will automatically de-identify and/or delete the educational institution's Personal Student Information within a commercially acceptable period of time if an educational institution has not demanded the deletion of Personal Student Information, as long as that information is not required to comply with our legal obligations, settle conflicts, or enforce our agreements. Even after deactivating an account or terminating a contract, all Personal Student Information maintained will remain subject to our Product Privacy Policy that was in place at that time.
c) Information Maintenance: We typically maintain information for as long as it may be applicable to the above purposes or as necessary or allowed by law other than Personal Student Information. We may anonymize it, remove it or take other reasonable de-identifying measures to dispose of any personal information. Please note that information can remain for an additional period of time in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes.
